# Portfolio Development Examples
This repository provides example portfolio example development in C#, Blazor, etc.

![Example Application process](https://github.com/makalkas/Portfolio_Development_Examples/blob/main/Images/2024-12-11%2018_42_56-Application%20Processes.vsdx%20-%20Visio%20Professional.png)
Most applications will generally follow a simple data flow process/method. 
The user clicks a button, the application should respond by accepting the user event. Some process kicks off from a timer/scheduler, etc. (Extract)
The operation should then transform some kind of data, wether that be a mouse location, a call to open another window, accept 
some kind of user input, move data, etc. this must transformed into some kind of useable data or work (Transform).
This transformed data must then be moved to different endpoints. Usually one of the endpoints is some kind of a graphic on the
screen. Another common endpoint is to a database, file/directory, or service. (Load)

## Example Blazor Architecture

The above Application process architecture is then expanded into what you see in the Blazor Architecture example (directly above) to allow for
efficient communication and processing. The different services allow the application to grow and change as the business does while reducing the
amount of work needed to upgrade the application.

# UI/UX

![Example Basic UI](https://github.com/makalkas/Portfolio_Development_Examples/blob/main/Images/UI-LabelApplication.png)

When building UI(s), getting user feed back is important. For this reason, I try to give the user a version that is devoid of any destractions until
I am ready to add the elements that will help make everything as intuitive as possible.
